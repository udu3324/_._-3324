<pre><h6>Warning! Right now, Discord is my only official social media account.
Dont talk to impersonators on other social media websites. </h6>
<h2>Website, QNA, Artwork Info</h2>Hey! If you want to use my artwork, 
contact me via discord! You can alter my renders/art as long as the watermark 
is still there and clearly visible. I will ask some simple questions then give 
you the pass if its ok if your purpose is fine. Please do not remove my
watermarks. Please just appreciate my art. There's a law that prevents 
you from doing that too.

Links that support my claim about not removing my watermarks:

[Question] You: What kind of website is this?!?!!?

[Awnser] _._#3324: This website is optimised for all computers and
its layout is based on the "Tree" command you run in command
prompt (sorry mac and linux users)

<h2>Who Am I?</h2>I am _._#3324, I make things in Blender.
I love designing architecture things in Blender and that's why you
see many of my stuff I make is a city. I hate textures (i mean the
texture as in a picture you slap onto an object) because
it's hard to make and put on. Usually, i finish a major blender
project in 2-3 weeks if its detailed like my "Realistic
City" blender project. It's very detailed and needs multiple
renders of it up close.

<h2>Contact Info</h2>Need to contact me? Well, you can!
Right now, I only have one way for people to contact me. Discord!
As long as you have discord and your question fits in my rules below
then you can contact me! Here are the rules:

• It can be a question about something like my artwork,
  website error, questions about _._#3324, (might not awnser all 
  of them because of personal reasons) and Discord errors.
  
• It can be a report about someone saying bad stuff your dms or someone
  advertising in your dms that is connected to my discord server.
  
• It cant criticize me, or other people.

• It cant be an opinion of me or any other people.
