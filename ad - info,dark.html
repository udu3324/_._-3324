[Question] You: What kind of website is this?!?!!?

[Awnser] _._#3324: This website is optimised for all computers and
its layout is based on the "Tree" command you run in command
prompt (sorry mac and linux users)

<h2>Who Am I?</h2>I am _._#3324, I make things in Blender and Cinema 4d.
I love designing architecture things and that's why you
see many of my stuff I make is a city. I hate textures (i mean the
texture as in a picture you slap onto an object) because
the procedure of uv editing, and other stuff takes a long time.
Usually, i finish a major blender project in 2-3
weeks if its detailed like my "Realistic City" blender project.
It's very detailed and needs multiple renders of it up close. 

<h2>Contact Info</h2>Need to contact me? Well, you can!
Right now, I only have one way for people to contact me. Discord!
As long as you have discord and your question fits in my rules below
then you can contact me! Here are the rules:

• It can be a question about something like my artwork,
  website error, questions about _._#3324, (might not answer all 
  of them) and Discord errors.
  
• It can be a report about someone saying bad stuff your dms or someone
  advertising in your dms that is connected to my discord server.
  
• It cant criticize me, or other people.

• It cant be an opinion of me or any other people.
